<h1>Proc</h1>
<p>Proc is a procedure object in which both a block and 
  its context (local variable scope and stack frame) have been encapsulated as 
  an object. Proc can be used like an unnamed function, except that it does not 
  have its own local variable scope.</p>
<p>We can see that Proc retains a local variable scope, 
  however, by observing that the variable <var>var</var> can be referenced, as 
  in the example below:</p>
<pre>
var = 1
$foo = Proc.new { var }
var = 2

def foo
  $foo.call
end

p foo       # =&gt; 2
</pre>

<h2>Class Method</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Proc.new</a></dt>
<dt>Proc.new { ... }</dt>
<dd>
    <p>Encapsulates a block, along with its context, into an object and returns 
      it.</p>
    <p>If no block is specified, but the method that called Proc.new contains 
      a block, that block will be created as a Proc object and returned.</p>
</dl>

<h2>Method</h2>
<dl>
<dt>call(<var>arg</var> ... )</a></dt>
<dd>
    <p>Executes a procedure object and returns the result. Arguments are assigned 
      to block parameters as is (according to the rules of multiple assignation).</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
