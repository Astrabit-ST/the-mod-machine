<h1>Method Calls</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="#L000322">super</a></li>
  <li><a href="#L000323">Iterators</a></li>
<li><a href="#L000324">yield</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
foo.bar()
foo.bar
bar()
print &quot;hello world\n&quot;
print
</pre>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre>
[expr '.'] identifier ['(' expr ... ['*' [expr]] ')']
</pre>
<p>Method calls invoke the method of the receiver (the value of the expression 
  to the left of the dot). If no receiver is specified, calls the method of self.</p>
<p>Method names can be normal identifiers or identifiers followed by the character 
  ? or !. Customarily, ? is used for predicates (methods returning true/false 
  values), while ! is used for methods that are more destructive than their !-less 
  counterparts (tr versus tr!).</p>
<p>If the last argument is preceded by *, the value of that expression is expanded 
  to its arguments:</p>
<pre>
foo(*[1,2,3])   # same as foo(1,2,3)
</pre>

<h2><a name="L000322">super</a></h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
super
super(1,2,3)
</pre>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre>
super
super(expr , ... )
</pre>
<p>super calls the method that is being overridden by the current method. If the 
  parentheses and arguments are omitted, the current method's arguments are passed 
  to super as is. To call the overridden method without passing any arguments, 
  indicate the parentheses as in super().</p>
<pre>
class Foo
  def foo(arg=nil)
    p arg
  end
end

class Bar &lt; Foo
  def foo(arg)
    super(5)       # called with 5 as an argument
    super(arg)     # called with 5 as an argument
    super          # called with 5 as an argument; abbreviation of super(arg)
    arg = 1
    super          # called with 1 as an argument; abbreviation of super(arg)
    super()        # called with no argument
  end
end
Bar.new.foo 5
</pre>

<h2><a name="L000323">Iterators</a></h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
[1,2,3].each do |i| print i*2, &quot;\n&quot; end
[1,2,3].each {|i| print i*2, &quot;\n&quot; }
</pre>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre>
method(arg1, arg2, ...)  do ['|' expr ... '|'] expr ... end
method(arg1, arg2, ...) '{' ['|' expr ... '|'] expr ... '}'
</pre>
<p>Iterators are methods used for abstracting control structures (especially loops). 
  If you call a method that is followed by a code segment enclosed by do ... end 
  or by { ... } (called a block), the method can evaluate the block from within. 
  Methods that call these kinds of blocks are called iterators. Block calls from 
  iterators use <a href="#L000324">yield</a>. The value passed to yield is assigned 
  to the variable between the two pipes ( | ).</p>
<p>{ ... } binds more strongly than a do ... end block.</p>
<pre>
foobar a, b do .. end   # foobar is called as an iterator
foobar a, b { .. }      # b is called as an iterator
</pre>
<p> Local variables that are first assigned (declared) in a block are only valid 
  within that block.</p>
<pre>
foobar {
  i = 20                # local variable 'i' is declared
   ...
}
                        # 'i' is undefined here
foobar a, b do
  i = 11                # declaration of a totally different variable 'i'
   ...
end
</pre>
<p>Like most methods, an iterator's return value is nil if it is interrupted by 
  <a href="syntax05.html#L000308">break</a> from within a block. When break has 
  an argument, that value will become the iterator's return value.</p>

<h2><a name="L000324">yield</a></h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
yield data
</pre>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre>
yield '(' [ expr [',' expr ... ]] ')'
yield [ expr [',' expr ... ]]
</pre>
<p>Passes the argument(s) as the block's argument(s) and evaluates the block. 
  yield is used within <a href="syntax07.html#L000330">MethodDefinition</a> to 
  define <a href="#L000323">iterators</a>.</p>
<pre>
def foo
  yield(1,2)
end

foo {|a,b| p [a,b]}
</pre>
<p>Assignment of the block argument(s) is carried out according to the rules of 
  <a href="syntax04.html#L000288">multiple assignment</a>. If no block is supplied 
  to the method that executed yield (i.e., it is not an iterator), throws a <a href="s_exceptions.html#LocalJumpError">LocalJumpError</a> 
  exception.</p>
<p>yield returns the result of the block's last evaluated expression. If block 
  execution has been interrupted by <a href="syntax05.html#L000309">next</a>, 
  returns nil. When next has an argument, that value will become yield's return 
  value.</p>
