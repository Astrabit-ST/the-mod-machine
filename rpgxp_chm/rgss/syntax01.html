<h1>Syntax and Expressions</h1>

<li><a href="#L000213">Identifiers</a></li>
<li><a href="#L000214">Comments</a></li>

<p>Ruby is a case-sensitive language. Apart from within identifiers and some literals, 
  blank space and comments may be placed anywhere as needed. Line breaks are treated 
  as blank space only when used to clearly show a line is continuing; otherwise, 
  they are treated as phrase delimiters.</p>

<h2><a name="L000213">Identifiers</a></h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
foobar
ruby_is_simple
</pre>
<p>An identifier in Ruby begins with an alphabetic character or underscore (_) and consists of alphanumeric characters or underscores (_). There is no 
  limit on length.</p>

<h2><a name="L000214">Comments</a></h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
# this is a comment line
</pre>
<p>Strings beginning with # are considered comments.</p>

<h2><a name="L000216">Reserved Words</a></h2>
<p>The following are reserved words:</p>
<pre>
BEGIN    class    ensure   nil      self     when
END      def      false    not      super    while
alias    defined? for      or       then     yield
and      do       if       redo     true
begin    else     in       rescue   undef
break    elsif    module   retry    unless
case     end      next     return   until
</pre>
<p>Reserved words cannot be used for names of classes, variables, or the like. 
  However, words prefixed by $ or @ are not considered reserved. Furthermore, 
  these words can be used as method names after def, after a method-call period, 
  and in other cases where it is clear that the word is acting as a method name.</p>

<h2><a name="L000219">Expressions</a></h2>
Example 
<pre>
true
(1+2)*3
foo()
if test then ok else ng end
</pre>
<p>The term &quot;expressions&quot; encompasses everything from variables and 
  literals to operational forms and control structures.</p>
<p>A collection of these expressions makes up a Ruby program. Expressions are 
  separated from one another with semicolons (;) or line breaks. However, a line 
  break following a backslash is not considered a new expression boundary; instead, 
  the expression continues on the next line.</p>
<p>Expressions can be grouped with parentheses.</p>
