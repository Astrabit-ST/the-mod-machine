<h1>Graphics</h1>
<p>The module that carries out graphics processing.</p>

<h2>Module Methods</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Graphics.update</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>Refreshes the game screen and advances time by 1 frame. This method must 
      be called at set intervals.</p>
    <pre>
loop do
  Graphics.update
  Input.update
  do_something
end
</pre>
    <p>If this method is not called in 10 seconds or more, the program will view 
      the script as having run out of control and will force a quit.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Graphics.freeze</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>Fixes the current screen in preparation for transitions.</p>
    <p>Screen rewrites are prohibited until the transition method is called.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="transition">Graphics.transition([<var>duration</var>[, <var>filename</var>[, 
    <var>vague</var>]]])</a></dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>Carries out a transition from the screen fixed in Graphics.freeze to the 
      current screen.</p>
    <p><var>duration</var> is the number of frames the transition will last. When 
      omitted, this value is set to 8.</p>
    <p><var>filename</var> specifies the transition graphic file name. When not 
      specified, a standard fade will be used. Also automatically searches files 
      included in <a href="rgss.html#rgss_rtp">RGSS-RTP</a> and <a href=
"rgss.html#encryption_archive">encrypted archives</a>. File extensions may be 
      omitted.</p>
    <p><var>vague</var> sets the ambiguity of the borderline between the graphic's 
      starting and ending points. The larger the value, the greater the ambiguity. 
      When omitted, this value is set to 40.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Graphics.frame_reset</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>Resets the screen refresh timing. After a time-consuming process, call 
      this method to prevent extreme frame skips.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Module Properties</h2>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="frame_rate">Graphics.frame_rate</a></dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>In [Smooth Mode], the number of times the screen is refreshed per second. 
      The larger the value, the more CPU power is required. Normally set at 40. 
      When not in [Smooth Mode], the refresh rate is halved, and graphics are drawn 
      in every other frame.</p>
    <p>Changing this property is not recommended; however, it can be set anywhere 
      from 10 to 120. Values out of range are automatically corrected.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Graphics.frame_count</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>The screen's refresh rate count. Set this property to 0 at game start and 
      the game play time (in seconds) can be calculated by dividing this value 
      by the frame_rate property value.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
