<h2><a name="game_run">Starting a Game</a></h2>
<img src="img/folder.png" alt="Game folder"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Normally, you launch RGSS by double-clicking the icon for the game file, <var>Game.exe</var> 
  (or <var>Game</var> if the Windows option &quot;Hide extensions for known file 
  types&quot; has been turned on). The folder that contains this file is called 
  the <var>game folder</var>.</p>
<p>In-progress games can be started up by selecting [Playtest] from the menu or 
  [Battle Test] from the Troop database. In both cases, the game will start in 
  debug mode, and the built-in Ruby variable <a href="s_variables.html#L000462">$DEBUG</a> 
  will be set automatically. While battle testing, the variable $BTEST will also 
  be set to true.</p>
<p>Game operation is specified in <a href="#game_ini">Game.ini</a>, the configuration 
  file.</p>

<h2><a name="game_ini">Game.ini</a></h2>
<p>The Game.ini file is automatically created and updated by RPGXP. It can also 
  be edited manually with Notepad or another text editor.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
[Game]
Library=RGSS100J.dll
Scripts=Data\Scripts.rxdata
Title=RubyQuest
RTP1=Standard
RTP2=
RTP3=
</pre>
<dl>
<dt>Library</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The name of the RGSS DLL. This file is usually installed in the Windows 
      system folder.</p>
    <p>If there's a DLL specified in the game folder, it will be given precedence.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scripts</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The data file in which scripts are stored, specified with a path relative 
      to the game folder.</p>
    <p>Ruby's scripts usually take the form of text files with the extension .rb, 
      but RGSS uses one proprietary packaged file. This file cannot usually be 
      edited without using RPGXP's script editor. The data is comprised of multiple 
      sections and is executed in the listed order, as displayed.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Title</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The game title, displayed in the game window's title bar.</p>
</dd>
<dt>RTP1</dt>
<dt>RTP2</dt>
<dt>RTP3</dt>
<dd>
    <p>The title of the RGSS-RTP the game is using. If the specified RTP isn't 
      installed, an error message will be displayed.</p>
    <p>If you place an RGSS DLL (specified by Library) in the game folder without 
      specifying an RTP, you can create a game that doesn't require RTP to be 
      installed. This distribution method isn't actively recommended, but it might 
      be advantageous when a large majority of the materials used are original 
      creations.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="rgss_rtp">RGSS-RTP</a></h2>
<p> RTP (Run Time Package) is a mechanism that reduces game data size for distribution. 
  RTP contains standard graphics and audio files used across many different games. 
  Installing these materials as a common file before playing a game eliminates 
  the need to download duplicate files over and over.</p>
<p> The RGSS-RTP configuration file can use the following methods from the built-in 
  game library to access files as though they were in the game folder. The extensions 
  can be left off the file names that are passed to the methods below--their file 
  types (such as .png or .mid) are identified automatically.</p>
<p><a
href="gc_bitmap.html#new">Bitmap.new</a>, <a
href="gm_audio.html#bgm_play">Audio.bgm_play</a>, <a
href="gm_audio.html#bgs_play">Audio.bgs_play</a>, <a
href="gm_audio.html#me_play">Audio.me_play</a>, <a
href="gm_audio.html#se_play">Audio.se_play</a>, <a
href="gm_graphics.html#transition">Graphics.transition</a></p>
<h3><a name="rgss_rtp_install">Installation Data</a></h3>
<p>RPGXP's default RTP is the single &quot;Standard&quot; type, but structurally 
  speaking, you can use multiple RTPs at the same time. If you know how to make 
  an installer, follow these steps to create a unique RTP at the user level. However, 
  using common names for RTP titles, such as &quot;Extension&quot;, is not recommended; 
  they might conflict with the names of new, official RTPs in the future.</p>
<p>By default, RTP is installed in the following folder:</p>
<pre>
[CommonFilesFolder]\Enterbrain\RGSS\[RTPName]
</pre>
Here, [CommonFilesFolder] is the location of the Windows &quot;Common Files&quot; 
folder, while [RTPName] is the name of the RTP. Here's an example: 
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Enterbrain\RGSS\Standard
</pre>
<p>The RTP installer creates a string value containing the RTP name in the &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Enterbrain\RGSS\RTP&quot; 
  registry key and uses it to set the path. RGSS recognizes the string specified 
  in this key as the RTP.</p>

<h2><a name="encryption_archive">Encrypted Archives</a></h2>
<p>Encrypted archives make it difficult for others to analyze and/or rebuild the 
  game contents. Normally all data and graphic files (not audio files) are stored 
  in Game.rgssad. You can create an encrypted archive by checking the [Create encrypted archive] box when compressing the game data.</p>
<p>The files within the encrypted archive can use the following methods from the 
  built-in game library to access files as though they were in the game folder:</p>
<p><a href="g_functions.html#load_data">load_data</a>, <a
href="gc_bitmap.html#new">Bitmap.new</a>, <a
href="gm_graphics.html#transition">Graphics.transition</a></p>
<p>When there is an encrypted archive in the game folder, the script data (normally 
  Data\Scripts.rxdata) defined in the Scripts line of <a href="#game_ini">Game.ini</a> 
  will always be read from the archive. This is a limitation that prevents files 
  within the archive from being read by an external script.</p>
<p>Due to its nature, the encrypted archive's internal format has not, and will not, been released 
  to the public. Please refrain from analyzing it.</p>

<h2><a name="others">Other</a></h2>

<h3><a name="character_code">Character Set</a></h3>
<p>RGSS uses the UTF-8 character set. UTF-8 is a way of encoding Unicode, a character 
  set that can display letters and characters from all the world's languages.</p>
<p>Ruby's built-in variable $KCODE (not included in this reference) is set to 
  &quot;UTF8&quot; by default. RPGXP's script data and all other string data are 
  also in UTF-8, so you don't have to worry about any encoding conflicts as you 
  build your game.</p>
<p>However, to guarantee proper operation, you should not create games that include characters only available in Unicode, as Windows 98 and Windows Me do not support it.</p>

<h3><a name="smooth_mode">Smooth Mode</a></h3>
<p>RGSS games usually run at 20 frames per second, but you can check [Smooth Mode] 
  in the game's Properties to run it at a 40 fps framerate instead. This is why 
  the scripts move at an internal rate of 40 fps whether [Smooth Mode] is on or 
  off. Be aware that most values, like wait length, will be handled as though 
  they've been doubled.</p>
<p>You can change the framerate with <a href="gm_graphics.html#frame_rate">Graphics.frame_rate</a>.</p>

<h3>
<a name="property">Properties</a></h2>
<p>The term &quot;property&quot; is used in the <a href="g_index.html">game library</a> 
  overview. This is not a concept in Ruby's specifications, but rather a term 
  unique to RGSS.</p>
<p>For example, this is how to obtain and set a sprite's x-coordinate (<a href="gc_sprite.html#x">Sprite#x</a>):</p>
<pre>
x = sprite1.x         # obtain
sprite2.x = x + 32    # set
</pre>
<p>For the sake of convenience, methods that are defined to both obtain (read) 
  and set (write) via assignment operators in this way are called &quot;properties&quot;.</p>
