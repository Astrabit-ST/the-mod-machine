<p>In RPGXP, the games you create are handled in bundles called <i>projects</i>. 
  When you create a project, a new folder is placed on your hard drive containing 
  the various types of data files used in your game.</p>

<h2><a name="create">Creating New Projects</a></h2>
<img src="img/project1.png" alt="Creating New Projects"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>To create a new game, select [File], then [New Project] from the main menu. 
  A dialog box will appear; enter the folder name and title as directed and click 
  [OK] to create a new project based on the information you provided.</p>
<p>The Game.rxproj file inside the new project folder represents your project. 
  Double-click this file to open its project directly. You might also want to 
  place a shortcut on your desktop pointing to the project(s) you're currently 
  working on.</p>

<h2><a name="rename">Changing Titles</a></h2>
<img src="img/project2.png" alt="Changing Titles"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>To change a project's title after a project has already been created, open 
  the project and select [Game], then [Change Title] from the main menu. A dialog 
  box will appear; enter the new title and click [OK] to make the change.</p>

<h2><a name="manage">Project Management</a></h2>
<p>RPGXP does not include a way to delete projects, change folder names, or perform 
  other &quot;housekeeping&quot; tasks. You may perform these tasks directly from 
  the Windows Explorer interface. </p>
<p>You can also make a duplicate of an entire game by copying a project folder. 
  As insurance against mistakes and to reduce the risk of data loss due to unforeseen 
  problems, we recommend making regular backups of the game(s) you're working 
  on.</p>


<h2><a name="redist">Distributing Games</a></h2>
<p>To distribute completed game data online, select [File], then [Compress 
  Game Data] from the main menu. The data will be compressed into a self-extracting 
  file and saved into the folder you specify. Use this file to start distributing 
  your game.</p>
<p>Users who don't have a copy of RPGXP will need to install RGSS-RTP separately, 
  so make sure you make this clear when distributing your game. (There is a way 
  to create games that don't require RTP, but it's not recommended.) Users can 
  download RGSS-RTP from the following location:</p>
<p></p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.rpg-makerxp.com" target="_blank">
http://www.rpg-makerxp.com</a>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you don't want anyone else to be able to use RPG Maker XP to view your game's 
  contents, you can specify that an encrypted archive be created when compressing 
  the game data. Encrypted archives are bigger than standard compressed files, 
  so it's best to only use them when necessary.</p>
<p>Instead of RPGXP's [Compress Game Data] function, you can use a separate data 
  compression program to compress your game folder. If you do, be sure not to 
  include the playtesting save data.</p>
