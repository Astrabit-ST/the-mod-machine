<p>The fields and dungeons, town exteriors and building interiors--any &quot;stage&quot; 
  where the player moves around is called a <i>map</i>.</p>
<p>Games are made up from multiple maps, and the player can come and go among 
  these various maps by way of events. For example, when a player steps into a 
  doorway, you can set off an invisible event that will transport him or her to 
  another map displaying the inside of that building. This is how all the maps 
  appear to be connected to one another.</p>


<h2><a name="tile">Tiles and Tilesets</a></h2>
<img src="img/map1.png" alt="Tiles"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Maps may look like a single picture, but in fact it's made up of many pieces 
  that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. These small pieces are called <i>tiles</i>, 
  and each tile contains information such as whether characters are allowed to 
  pass through it.</p>
<p>A collection of multiple tiles that represent certain settings, each with their 
  own configuration, is called a <i>tileset</i>. Each map uses a single tileset whose 
  tiles are then placed on the map. Tilesets also include information for battle 
  backgrounds to be displayed during battles that take place on that particular 
  map, so you automatically gain access to a setting-appropriate background just 
  by selecting a tileset.</p>


<h2><a name="create">Creating New Maps</a></h2>
<img src="img/map2.png" alt="Creating New Maps"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Map creation takes place in the map tree view, in the lower left of the main 
  window.</p>
<p>First, right-click on a map or a project folder and select [New Map] from the 
  pop-up menu. You'll be shown a dialog box containing settings that cover the 
  tileset to be used, the size of the map, and so on. Fill in the necessary information 
  and click [OK]. Check the Pop-up hints for more information on each setting.</p>
<p>After the map has been configured, a new map will be created below the one 
  you right-clicked initially. This has the same hierarchy as Windows folders. 
  While this structure has no direct effect on the game, using it wisely can make 
  it easier to manage a large number of maps; for example, by placing the interior 
  maps of all the buildings in a village below the village map. You can change 
  the hierarchy simply by dragging and dropping.</p>


<h2><a name="layer">Layers</a></h2>
<img src="img/map3.png" alt="Layers"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Maps have 3 layers, each one containing different tiles. You're free to place 
  anything you like on any layer, but your mapmaking may go more smoothly if, 
  as a general rule, you place land on layer 1, fences and buildings on layer 
  2, and windows and chimneys on layer 3.</p>
<p>Layers edited in the map editor can be selected with [Mode] on the main menu. 
  You can also change various settings under the [View] menu, such as whether 
  to darken all layers except the one you're currently working on.
<h2><a name="draw">Placing Tiles</a></h2>
<p>The tiles you place on a map are selected from the tile palette on the left 
  side of the main window. You can select multiple tiles at once by clicking and 
  dragging within the tile palette. Selected tiles can then be placed in the map 
  view, on the right side; it's a little like using a painting program.</p>
<p>Set the tile placement method with [Draw] on the main menu. Here's a rundown 
  of the drawing tools and their capabilities:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Pencil</dt>
  <dd>The standard drawing method. Places a tile where you click the mouse.</dd>
  <dt>Rectangle</dt>
  <dd>Define a rectangle by dragging out a diagonal line; this rectangle will be filled 
    with the selected tile.</dd>
  <dt>Ellipse</dt>
  <dd>Define a circle by dragging out a diagonal line; this circle will be filled 
    with the selected tile.</dd>
  <dt>Fill</dt>
  <dd>All identical tiles adjacent to the tile you click will be filled with the 
    selected tile.</dd>
  <dt>Select</dt>
  <dd>Define an area of the map to cut or copy. Once an area is selected, right-click 
    to make a pop-up menu appear that will allow you to copy, paste, and use other 
    editing commands. Copy and cut apply to all layers within the selected area.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Right-click on the map view with any drawing tool besides [Select] to select 
  the tile placed at that point. This function is called the <i>eyedropper</i>. 
  Making good use of the eyedropper can allow you to skip the tile palette altogether, 
  increasing efficiency. </p>


<h2><a name="autotile">Autotiles</a></h2>
<img src="img/map4.png" alt="Autotiles"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>The tiles displayed in the very top row of the tile palette are a special variety 
  called <i>autotiles</i>. Autotiles contain multiple patterns per tile type, 
  automatically adjusting their borders as they're placed on the map.</p>
<p>Press [Shift] while placing tiles or using the eyedropper to temporarily disable 
  the autotile function.</p>
<p>Double-click an autotile in the tile palette to make the Autotile Expansion 
  dialog box appear. Here you can select autotile border patterns directly.</p>
