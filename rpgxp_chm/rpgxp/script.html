<p>The basic programs responsible for running the game are called <i>scripts</i>.</p>
<p>Generally, commands like [Show Text] can also be called &quot;scripts&quot;, 
  but in RPGXP, scripts are even more than event commands and are closer to the 
  concept of a computer program. Event commands are not actually handled by the 
  program, but are in fact parsed at the script level.</p>
<p>Script editing is a difficult task, aimed at advanced users who wish to customize 
  the game system itself. However, there is absolutely no need to learn anything 
  about scripting if you only intend to create a game in the usual way. At first, 
  just try your hand at game creation without worrying about scripts; when the 
  default system isn't good enough for your needs, it's time to take a closer 
  look at scripting.</p>

<h2><a name="ruby">About Ruby</a></h2>
<p>RPGXP's script engine doesn't use a proprietary simplified language, but the 
  powerful scripting language Ruby. Ruby's official Website is <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="_blank"> 
  http://www.ruby-lang.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Ruby is freeware developed chiefly by Yukihiro Matsumoto, and its capabilities 
  are more than sufficient to script a large-scale game. However, since it was 
  originally conceived to be specialized in text handling and the like, it's a 
  challenge to develop a game using Ruby alone. That's why RPGXP uses RGSS (the 
  Ruby Game Scripting System) to adapt Ruby for use in game development. See the 
  <a href="../rgss/index.html">RGSS Reference</a> for details.</p>
<p>The language can be referred to as &quot;Ruby&quot; or &quot;ruby&quot;, but 
  not as &quot;RUBY&quot;.</p>


<h2><a name="editor">The Script Editor</a></h2>
<img src="img/script1.png" alt="The Script Editor"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Select [Tools], then [Script Editor] from the main menu to open a large dialog 
  box for editing scripts.</p>
<p>Since a very large number of programs are needed to run a large-scale game 
  such as an RPG, they must be divided up into more manageable pieces. In RPGXP, 
  these pieces are called <i>sections</i>; sections are listed on the left side of the 
  script editor.</p>
<p>The script editor has been configured to be used in much the same way as the 
  database. Press F4 and F5 quickly select the previous and next sections in the 
  list. You can also press F6 to copy a section using the word at the cursor position 
  as the section name.</p>


<h2><a name="section">Sections</a></h2>
<img src="img/script2.png" alt="Sections"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Right-click on a section name to make a pop-up window appear. Select [Insert] 
  to add a new, blank section before the selected position. In the same way, select 
  [Cut], [Paste], and other editing commands to change the section order.</p>
<p>Unlike the database, sections aren't managed by ID numbers. Sections are run 
  in the order in which they appear in the list; that is, from top to bottom. 
  Preset scripts have a section called &quot;Main&quot; at the very bottom, and 
  actual game functions are set to begin after each definition has ended.</p>


<h2><a name="edit">Editing</a></h2>
<img src="img/script3.png" alt="Editing"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>Right-click in the text editor area on the right side of the window to bring 
  up a pop-up window like the one here. This window lets you perform basic editing 
  functions like [Cut] and [Paste], as well as [Find] and [Replace].</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+F and Ctrl+G will work even when the text editor 
  is not the active window.</p>
<p>When you want to search for a string in all sections, not just the one currently 
  being edited, selected [Find] from the pop-up section menu. The corresponding 
  keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+F.</p>


<h2><a name="use">Using Scripts</a></h2>
<p>There are 3 ways to use scripts apart from editing them directly in the script 
  editor:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With the [Script] event command.</li>
  <li>As conditions in the [Conditional Branch] event command.</li>
  <li>As commands in [Move Route].</li>
</ol>
<p>These methods can be used when, for example, you want to call unique event 
  commands you've added via the script editor. As you become more proficient at 
  scripting, you may find even more interesting ways to use them.</p>
