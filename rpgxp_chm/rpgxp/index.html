<h1>RPG Maker XP</h1>
<p>RPG Maker XP (RPGXP) is a specialized construction tool for making role-playing 
  games. The games you create can be played by other users, even if they don't 
  have a copy of RPGXP.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>High-Resolution Graphics</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>You can use 32-bit graphics measuring up to 640 x 480 pixels. Smooth transparency 
      processing and flexible translucent effects are possible, thanks to full 
      alpha channel (per-pixel transparency) support. RPGXP features addition 
      and subtraction screen blending modes along with the usual transparency 
      blend. Fonts are automatically antialiased, smoothing their edges and eliminating 
      &quot;pixelly&quot; text.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Software-Based Audio Playback</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>Background music (BGM) is chiefly handled by DirectMusic Synthesizer MIDI 
      playback. Software-based playback means you can't use external audio sources; 
      on the other hand, composers of audio files don't have to worry about their 
      creations supporting various kinds of MIDI sources. If a MIDI file plays 
      properly in the environment where it was created, you can expect it to play 
      in exactly the same way in any and all environments.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Flexible, Powerful Scripting</dt>
  <dd> 
    <p>The games you create in RPGXP are coded in the scripting language Ruby. 
      You can make plenty of interesting games using only the program's built-in 
      scripts, but for more advanced game creation, you also have the flexibility 
      to customize everything about your game--from screen layout to the battle 
      system and everything in between. You're not even limited to making only 
      RPGs.</p>
