<p>Every &quot;happening&quot; in the game, from villagers who give you information 
  to item-filled treasure chests, is called an <i>event</i>.</p>
<p>Since the direction of the game is controlled entirely by events, even something 
  like the player exiting a town onto a field map must be configured as an event.</p>


<h2><a name="type">Types of Events</a></h2>
<p>There are three types of events: map events, battle events, and common events. 
  The term &quot;event&quot; by itself generally refers to a map event.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Map Events</dt>
  <dd>These are events that take place on the map screen, used for movement, conversations, 
    etc. Select [Mode], then [Event] from the main menu, then double-click on 
    a map to create a map event. Placing a large number of map events can put 
    a strain on the CPU--a safe amount would be 100 or fewer events per map.</dd>
  <dt>Battle Events</dt>
  <dd>These are events that take place on the battle screen. For example, you 
    can use a battle event to make an enemy transform when its HP drops below 
    a certain level. These events are accessed via [Troops] in the database.</dd>
  <dt>Common Events</dt>
  <dd>These generic events are called from map events and battle events, can be 
    configured to handle the use of special items, and so on. They are accessed 
    via [Common Events] in the database.</dd>
</dl>


<h2><a name="page">Event Pages</a></h2>
<img src="img/event1.png" alt="The Event Page"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em"> 
<p>You can configure handling for several different items in a single map event. 
  This is done on an <i>event page.</i></p>
<p>Each event page allows you to set 2 switches, a variable, and a selfswitch 
  as conditions for an event to &quot;manifest&quot;. If more than one event page 
  satisfies the given conditions, the page with the highest number will be used.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Switch</dt>
  <dd>Data stored as either ON or OFF throughout the game. For example, controls 
    information such as whether a player has received an order to defeat a monster 
    or whether a boss has been defeated.</dd>
  <dt>Variable</dt>
  <dd>Data stored as any integer (maximum 8 numbers long) throughout the game. 
    For example, controls information such as the hero's reputation level or the 
    number of items a player has gathered from around the world and given to a 
    particular person.</dd>
  <dt>Selfswitch</dt>
  <dd>A special switch for individual events. It has no visible effect, but rather 
    is used simply to display the status of a given event. For example, controls 
    information such as whether the player has opened a treasure chest.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Battle events also have event pages, but they're a little different from map 
  events. See <a href="#battle">Battle Events</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Common events do not have event pages. However, you can set 1 switch as a condition 
  for autorun events and the like.</p>


<h2><a name="trigger">Triggers</a></h2>
<p>The condition(s) that actually set off a process defined under [List of Event Commands] 
  on an event page is called a <i>trigger</i>.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Action Button</dt>
  <dd>The event runs when the player presses the action button (C) when in contact 
    with the event. The event also runs even if there's a counter tile between 
    the player and the event. Use this trigger for basic actions such as speaking 
    with villagers and examining treasure chests.</dd>
  <dt>Player Touch</dt>
  <dd>The event runs under the same conditions as the [Action Button] trigger, as 
    well as when the player uses the directional buttons to come in contact with 
    the event. The event will run when the player and event overlap as well, provided 
    that is permitted. Use this trigger for movement events.</dd>
  <dt>Event Touch</dt>
  <dd>The event runs under the same conditions as the [Player Touch] trigger, 
    as well as when the event comes in contact with the player. Use this to trigger 
    a battle when a player touches a monster wandering around the map.</dd>
  <dt>Autorun</dt>
  <dd>The event runs the moment it appears. It will continue to loop as long as 
    the condition(s) on the event page are being satisfied, so you must activate 
    a switch or a selfswitch at the appropriate time to modify the run conditions. 
    Use this trigger to force an event when, for example, moving onto a particular 
    map.</dd>
  <dt>Parallel Process</dt>
  <dd>The event runs at regular intervals as long as it is present. Parallel process 
    has different properties than normal process; because it's specially configured 
    to run parallel to other events running at the same time, using them requires 
    some caution. Use this trigger to check on a timer, flash lightning across 
    the screen at set intervals, and so on. You can make a game without using 
    parallel process triggers at all, so don't feel you have to know everything 
    there is to know about them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because common events don't have a tangible presence like map events, their 
  process can only be set to [None], [Autorun], and [Parallel Process] when they 
  are called. However, no matter what the trigger setting, you must be careful 
  when running parallel events called by a Parallel Process trigger. When you 
  want to run a regular event from a Parallel Process trigger, don't call a 
  common event directly; instead, you must use a switch to set off an Autorun 
  event.</p>
<p>Events that use parallel process put an especially large strain on the CPU. 
  Because condition changes brought about by switches and variables require judgments 
  as to whether an appearing or disappearing event is present, comparatively more 
  process time is needed for event pages on maps. Therefore, running multiple 
  parallel process events at any given time is not recommended.</p>


<h2><a name="battle">Battle Events</a></h2>
<img src="img/event2.png" alt="Battle Events"
 style="float:right;margin-left=1.5em;margin-bottom=1.0em">
<p>Events that occur in battle are called <i>battle events</i>.</p>
<p>Event pages for battle events don't include the notion of the event &quot;manifesting&quot;, 
  as they do for map events. Normally all event pages are checked in numeric order, 
  and the event is run as soon a page fulfills the given conditions.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of battle event conditions--number of turns used, enemy HP, 
  actor HP, and switch--and more than one can be specified at a time. Check the 
   Pop-up Hints for more information on each of these.</p>


<h2><a name="command">List of Event Commands</a></h2>
<p>Commands that bring about some sort of change while a game is being played 
  are called <i>event commands</i>.</p>
<p>The contents of events that are being processed are defined by a list of the 
  necessary event commands. There are a total of 90 types of event commands, a 
  wide range including [Show Text], [Transfer Player], and [Battle Process].</p>
<p>List of event commands can be edited in the same way as all event types. Follow these 
  steps to add a new event command:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Double-click a row marked by &quot;&#064;&#062;&quot;.</li>
  <li>The [Event Command] dialog box will appear. Click the button for the command 
    you'd like to add. You can also call up a Pop-up Hint for each button to read 
    a simple explanation of each command.</li>
  <li>For most commands, a dialog box will appear allowing you to set concrete 
    actions for the event command. When the necessary settings are complete, click 
    [OK].</li>
  <li>Your new event command will appear in the row you double-clicked in step 
    1. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once an event command is selected from the list of event commands, right-click 
  to make a pop-up menu appear that will allow you to copy, paste, and use other 
  editing commands. Press [Shift] while selecting event commands to work with more 
  than one at a time.</p>


<h2><a name="message">Showing Text</a></h2>
<p>To display messages on the game screen, use the [Show Text] event command. 
  This is usually the most frequently used of all event commands.</p>
<p>The following control characters are available for use in text mesages:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>\V[<var>n</var>]</dt>
  <dd>Will be replaced by the value in variable number <var>n</var>.</dd>
  <dt>\N[<var>n</var>]</dt>
  <dd>Will be replaced by the name of actor number <var>n</var>.</dd>
  <dt>\C[<var>n</var>]</dt>
<dd>Displays the characters that follow in color number <var>n</var>.
<table class="sys" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">
